/*
get a random number less than 10,
wait three seconds
write the number to the hard drive
Then, once all that is done, console log "I'm done!"

CONSTRAINTS
- Don't generate your own number, use getNumLessThanTen
- No using setTimeout (must use waitOneSecond)
- No using fs.writeFile (use writeToHardDrive)
- No editing any file except main.js

NOTES
- the implementation of getNumLessThanTen is more complex than necessary. It is implemented in that manner solely to make it an asynchronous function.
